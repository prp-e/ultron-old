## What's project Ultron? 

Project Ultron is a _Question Answering Network_ (QANet for short) which uses [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) as a backend. For this particular projcet, I user [ktrain](https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain) which is a great interface for _Keras_. 

## How to run this project? 

Just clone the repository then run: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And wait for the requirements to be installed. Remember in order to get it to work, you have to have _tensorflow_ installed on your system as well. This is tested on Linux, test it on macOS or Windows and give me feedbacks. 

_NOTE_: For the first run, it needs to download a few gigabytes of needed data for _BERT_. So be patient.
